# CommentRemover
Removes comments from C# (*.cs) code files.

This will remove all full-line, ending-line (after code), and XML (///) code comments.

Ending-line omments that contain a double quote (") and block comments (/* */) are not handled yet.

Support for VB comments may be added in the future.
